PC Speaker Piezzo Buzzer:
-------------------------
Resistance: 12 Ohm

@5V: U = R * I
     I = U / R
	 I = 5V / 12 Ohm = 416mA
	 
-> series resistor needed to limit current, e.g. 100Ohm

@5V: I = U / R
     I = 5V / (12 Ohm + 100 Ohm) = 45mA
     
     P = U * I
     P = 5V * 45mA = 0.225W -> 0.25W resistor is enough
     
     to be safe, choose 200R or even 510R
	 

ULN2803 Darlington Array:
-------------------------

max load: 500mA



relay module
------------

ELEGOO 8ch relay module, behind TSX0108 3.3V->5V level shifter

TSX0108 has an output enable pin that needs to be set to put a level on the output pins

Low level on STM32 pin means relay switches on (active low, inverted logic).

Activating a relay drains about 70mA of current from the 5V rail
